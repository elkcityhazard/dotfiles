## A Simple Neovim Config

Although you are welcome to fork this neovim config, I must advise caution.  

This config is specifically tailored to my needs and my not work for yours.  

It has some specific configuration for windows/wsl and is mostly tailored towards

javascript/typescript and go languages. 

It some other language specific stuff as well, but not nearly as evolved.  

If you are looking to start out with neovim, I would suggest looking up [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim "Neovim Kickstart on Github")
